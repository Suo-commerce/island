# Island

Island is a signed, hash-chained log with a gate in front of it: the place
where verses about projects and work are written, judged against a policy
that can only be tightened, and replicated for verification. Flare is its
personal console. Both live in this one Cargo workspace.

The specification is [`docs/spec.md`](docs/spec.md). The repo is at build
step 1 of its "Build order": every crate is an empty library, and the rules
that keep the two halves apart are already enforced.

## Layout

| Path | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `crates/island-*` | The log, gate, authority, broker, client, CLI, reference model and harness |
| `crates/flare-*` | Flare's core, replica link, session server and terminal client |
| `docs/spec.md` | The technical spec for slice 1 |
| `harness/seeds/` | The archive of every seed that ever failed the harness |
| `clippy.toml` | The determinism bans |
| `scripts/check-deps.py`, `deny.toml` | The dependency rules; licences, advisories and sources |

## Rules CI enforces

- No `island-*` crate depends on a `flare-*` crate.
- `flare-*` crates reach Island only through `island-core`, `island-log` and
  `island-client`.
- `island-gate` and `island-model` depend only on `island-core`.
- Outside `island-env`, no crate reads the clock, draws randomness, starts a
  thread or uses `HashMap`/`HashSet`. Unsafe code is forbidden everywhere.

## Working in the repo

Needs [just](https://github.com/casey/just) and
[cargo-deny](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny); the Rust
toolchain is pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`.

```sh
just check              # format, Clippy with the bans, dependency rules
just test               # unit and component tests
just SEEDS=500 harness  # the seeded harness (from build step 4)
```

Changes to Taso go to the Taso repo as pull requests, never as a fork here.
